      <h4>ANALYSIS OF HEART DISEASE AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE SEXES</h4>
      <p>This is a blog post on medium that I wrote in 2018 looking at the distribution of people with a heart problems mainly focusing on their sex and whether they experienced some sort of chest pain (Angina).
            It was is a post with a very special place in my heart as I have alot of passion in using Data Science and AI in Healthcare as I aim to use this technology to enable early detection of dieseses with out long, painful and expesive tests.
            this blog post only goes in the statistical distribution of the various groups and not the prediction using Machine Learning algorithms.
